J.B., P.L., S.B., and P.R. initiated the design of the study that led to this paper. P.R. led the analysis and designed the figures. P.R. wrote the article with input from P.L., S.B. and J.B. All authors contributed to the writing at all stages.

This project uses a observation-based ensemble and model ensemble to analyse seasonal and annual air-sea CO2 fluxes in the North Atlantic basin and the Southern Ocean. The observation-based ensemble members can be accessed here: http://www.bgc-jena.mpg.de/SOCOM/. The MPI-GE members can be accessed here: https://esgf-data.dkrz.de/projects/mpi-ge/. The pre-processing for the data can be found in the processing file. Due to their large size, the files are not attached.

The scripts used to analyse the data and the final figures are in the scripts folder.
